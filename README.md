# ColorMixer

Hey community,

I work as a web designer and sometimes I need some graded colors. So I made myself a little tool: The ColorMixer.
It works very well. But I taught myself JAVA and I don't know if it is compliant programming.
Please take a look at the source code and tell me if I made any mistakes or if it is possible to optimize the code. Thanks a lot :)

Notice:

The behavior of the fader/slider is different on macOS and Windows/Linux.
On Mac the fader jumps to the place you clicked. This function is more comfortable for the operation.
On Windows/Linux the fader only jumps one value in the direction where you click.


Future ideas:
- Implementing a pointer that picks up every color on the desktop
- More cue settings
- Controlling SmartHome WLAN lights with Tuya (JSON, MQTT)
- Controlling DMX lights over WLAN using an ESP8266
